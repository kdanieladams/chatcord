# ChatCord App
Realtime chat app with websockets using Node.js, Express and Socket.io with Vanilla JS on the frontend with a custom UI.  Based on Brad Traversy's ChatCord: https://github.com/bradtraversy/chatcord .  I've employed the use of `window.sessionStorage` instead of query strings, and added `dotenv` for environment dependent configuration.

## Usage
```
npm install
npm run dev

Go to localhost:3000
```
